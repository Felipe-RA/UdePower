    "# **PURPOSE OF THE NOTEBOOK**\n",
    "\n",
    " This notebook is designed to develop and train a predictive model aimed at optimizing power consumption in a laptop while minimizing the impact on system performance. The primary goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate power savings and suggest optimizations that balance power efficiency with system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The First Step. What are we going to predict?**\n",
    "\n",
    " The objective of the model is to predict `estimated_power_savings`. This feature represents the potential power savings that can be achieved through various optimizations. In addition to focusing on power savings, it is crucial to identify features that are critical to maintaining system performance. These features include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **CPU-related Features:**\n",
    "   - `cpu_power_state`: Represents the power states of the CPU, including active and idle times. This is important as it directly impacts power consumption and performance.\n",
    "   - `frequency_stats`: Indicates the CPU frequency statistics and how often each frequency is used. Higher frequencies generally mean better performance but increased power consumption.\n",
    "   - `average_cpu_frequency`: The average CPU frequency over the monitoring period. This provides insight into the overall CPU performance.\n",
    "   - `cpu_temperature`: Higher temperatures can lead to thermal throttling, reducing performance to prevent overheating.\n",
    "   - `cpu_utilization_avg`: The average CPU utilization percentage, reflecting how much the CPU is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **GPU-related Features:**\n",
    "   - `gpu_power_usage`: Power usage of the GPU, a significant component of overall power consumption.\n",
    "   - `gpu_core_clock`: GPU core clock frequency, indicating the speed of the GPU.\n",
    "   - `gpu_memory_clock`: GPU memory clock frequency, affecting memory performance.\n",
    "   - `gpu_temperature`: Similar to CPU temperature, it impacts thermal management and potential throttling.\n",
    "   - `gpu_utilization`: GPU utilization percentage, reflecting how much the GPU is being used.\n",
    "   - `gpu_memory_utilization`: Indicates how much of the GPU memory is being utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Display-related Features:**\n",
    "   - `display_backlight_power`: Power consumption by the display backlight. The display is a significant power consumer, and managing its power usage can yield considerable savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are critical because they collectively represent the primary components affecting both power consumption and performance. By carefully analyzing these features, we can ensure that our model suggests optimizations that do not significantly degrade system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Model Solution. What kind of predictive task do we have? How are we going to optimize for multiple features?**\n",

    "## Achieving Multi-Objective Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the goal of optimizing for multiple objectives—power savings and maintaining system performance—we can explore several strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Approach:**\n",
    "\n",

    " ## Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 1. Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    " In this step, we will train various regression models to predict `estimated_power_savings`. The process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Splitting the Data:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. A common split is 80% training and 20% testing.\n",
    " - **Training Models:** Train multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and XGBoost. Each model will be trained using the training set.\n",
    " - **Evaluating Models:** Assess the performance of each model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This will help us understand how well the models predict `estimated_power_savings`.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 2. Multi-Objective Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    " Given our dual objectives—optimizing power savings while maintaining system performance—we will implement strategies to handle multiple objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Weighted Loss Function:** Combine power savings and performance into a single loss function by assigning weights to each objective. This allows us to balance the trade-off between power savings and performance degradation. The loss function can be fine-tuned to prioritize one objective over the other based on the desired outcome.\n",
    " - **Multi-Output Regression:** Train models that can predict multiple targets simultaneously, such as `estimated_power_savings` and performance metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, GPU utilization). This approach captures the relationship between power savings and performance, enabling more informed optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 3. Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    " After training the models, we will validate their performance to ensure robustness and generalizability:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to evaluate model performance on different subsets of the data. This helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    " - **Performance Comparison:** Compare the performance of different models based on validation metrics. This involves analyzing the trade-offs between power savings and performance to select the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    " To enhance the performance of our selected model, we will perform hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Grid Search:** Systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameters to find the combination that yields the best performance. This method involves training the model with different hyperparameter combinations and evaluating their performance.\n",
    " - **Random Search:** Randomly sample hyperparameters from a defined range and evaluate model performance. This approach can be more efficient than grid search, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 5. Final Model Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    " With the optimal hyperparameters identified, we will implement the final model:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Training with Optimal Hyperparameters:** Retrain the model on the entire training dataset using the best hyperparameters identified during tuning.\n",
    " - **Testing on Hold-Out Set:** Evaluate the final model on the hold-out test set to assess its performance in predicting `estimated_power_savings` while maintaining system performance.\n",
    " - **Analysis and Interpretation:** Analyze the results to understand the impact of different features on power savings and performance. This includes examining feature importance scores and the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 6. Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    " Based on the results, we may explore additional techniques and improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Advanced Optimization Techniques:** Investigate methods like Pareto optimization to better handle the trade-offs between power savings and performance. Pareto optimization identifies non-dominated solutions where improving one objective cannot degrade the other.\n",
    " - **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Implement RL agents to dynamically optimize power consumption and performance based on real-time data. This approach allows for continuous learning and adaptation to changing conditions.\n",
    " - **Continuous Monitoring and Updating:** Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance. This involves setting up a feedback loop to incorporate new insights and improve the model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    " By following this detailed step-by-step process, we aim to develop a robust and efficient model that optimizes power consumption while maintaining system performance. The comprehensive approach ensures that we carefully consider multiple objectives and select the best solution for our goal."
