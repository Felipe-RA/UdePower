    "# **PURPOSE OF THE NOTEBOOK**\n",
    "\n",
    " This notebook is designed to develop and train a predictive model aimed at optimizing power consumption in a laptop while minimizing the impact on system performance. The primary goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate power savings and suggest optimizations that balance power efficiency with system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The First Step. What are we going to predict?**\n",
    "\n",
    " The objective of the model is to predict `estimated_power_savings`. This feature represents the potential power savings that can be achieved through various optimizations. In addition to focusing on power savings, it is crucial to identify features that are critical to maintaining system performance. These features include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **CPU-related Features:**\n",
    "   - `cpu_power_state`: Represents the power states of the CPU, including active and idle times. This is important as it directly impacts power consumption and performance.\n",
    "   - `frequency_stats`: Indicates the CPU frequency statistics and how often each frequency is used. Higher frequencies generally mean better performance but increased power consumption.\n",
    "   - `average_cpu_frequency`: The average CPU frequency over the monitoring period. This provides insight into the overall CPU performance.\n",
    "   - `cpu_temperature`: Higher temperatures can lead to thermal throttling, reducing performance to prevent overheating.\n",
    "   - `cpu_utilization_avg`: The average CPU utilization percentage, reflecting how much the CPU is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **GPU-related Features:**\n",
    "   - `gpu_power_usage`: Power usage of the GPU, a significant component of overall power consumption.\n",
    "   - `gpu_core_clock`: GPU core clock frequency, indicating the speed of the GPU.\n",
    "   - `gpu_memory_clock`: GPU memory clock frequency, affecting memory performance.\n",
    "   - `gpu_temperature`: Similar to CPU temperature, it impacts thermal management and potential throttling.\n",
    "   - `gpu_utilization`: GPU utilization percentage, reflecting how much the GPU is being used.\n",
    "   - `gpu_memory_utilization`: Indicates how much of the GPU memory is being utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Display-related Features:**\n",
    "   - `display_backlight_power`: Power consumption by the display backlight. The display is a significant power consumer, and managing its power usage can yield considerable savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are critical because they collectively represent the primary components affecting both power consumption and performance. By carefully analyzing these features, we can ensure that our model suggests optimizations that do not significantly degrade system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Model Solution. What kind of predictive task do we have? How are we going to optimize for multiple features?**\n",
    "\n",
    " The predictive task at hand is a regression task, where we aim to predict a continuous target variable, `estimated_power_savings`. However, our goal is multi-objective: we want to optimize power consumption while also considering system performance.\n",

    "## Achieving Multi-Objective Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the goal of optimizing for multiple objectives—power savings and maintaining system performance—we can explore several strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Combine multiple objectives into a single loss function by assigning weights to each objective.\n",

    "    - May not capture complex relationships between objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Output Regression\n",

    "    - Use Pareto optimization to identify solutions that offer the best trade-offs between multiple objectives.\n",
    "    - Generate a Pareto front, representing the set of non-dominated solutions where no objective can be improved without degrading another.\n",
    "  - **Advantages:**\n",
    "    - Provides a clear view of trade-offs between objectives.\n",
    "    - Helps in selecting optimal solutions based on preferences.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantages:**\n",

    "    - Requires more complex optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",

Depending on the results, we may explore more advanced techniques like Pareto optimization and reinforcement learning in future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this notebook will guide us through the process of developing a predictive model to optimize power consumption while maintaining system performance. We will explore different modeling approaches, evaluate their advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately focus on implementing XGBoost due to its powerful capabilities in handling complex datasets and achieving high predictive accuracy."
